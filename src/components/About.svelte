    <div class="section-text">
        While I'm young, with not much experience, I learn quick and I am always willing to take on challenging tasks and learn more.
        Like any human I make mistakes, but I have taught myself to never repeat the same mistake twice - no matter the outcome of a situation I learn something valuable and as such I am not scared of failure.
        I make logical and data driven decisions and even in situations where this not possible, I make decisions based on my intuition and experience.
        Along with this, I work well in high pressure situations and handle stress well.
